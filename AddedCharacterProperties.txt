The following is a list of properties added to characters which are not part of the Unicode standard proper. Although the "proper" names are given here, they are, as usual, stored in the character's table in their normalized forms.

Original_Name
    Contains the character's original, non-normalized name. If Name=[[latinsmallq]], then Original_Name=[[LATIN SMALL LETTER Q]]

Numeric_Canonical_Combining_Class
    Contains the numeric version of the character's Canonical_Combining_Class. If this value would be 0, then it is replaced with nil instead.

Rational_Numeric_Value
    If the numeric value of a character is expressed as a rational number, it is presented here as a table with the keys "num" and "den" for the numerator and denominator, respectively.

Numeric_Age
    If a character has an assigned age, it will be represented here as a float value.

Lowercase_Mapping_Condition
Titlecase_Mapping_Condition
Uppercase_Mapping_Condition
    If relevant, has the name of the context function used to determine if the relevant full casemapping applies. The name of the context function is *not* normalized.
